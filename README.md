# DROMOR
This is the matlab code for the paper "Distributionally Robust Model Order Reduction for Linear Systems"
DROMOR2 for single run, DROMOR_Ave for Monte Carlo
The value of $\alpha$ and $\delta_t$ needs to ensure the stability of the system.
1d heat, mass-spring-damper, random schur are functions that generating systems for test.
